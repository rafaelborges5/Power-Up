## Points of Action (20 minutes)

_Main discussion points for this week's meeting_

- Ask for Florentin's feedback on the issues on Gitlab. Were the issues named well? How descriptive were the issue descriptions? Does it meet professional standards?
- Have a fresh look over our page designs, where can we improve? Ask Florentin for a neutral, unbiased opinion.
- How far have we come in terms of learning the frameworks? Are we ready to start coding? If not, how far away are we?
- Do we have anything to add to the issues list on gitlab?
- Previous week recap:
  - After the meeting last week, we first worked on the code of conduct and the teamwork exercises. We then worked on the skeleton structure of the game together. We used loose ER notation to denote the different class structures. Ask team members for opinion on how the meeting went, did we achieve our goal?
  - We all agreed that the lecture videos were insufficient to fully understand the frameworks, we therefore delegated learning Spring Boot and Java FX within the group. Ansh and Rafael focused on front-end, Som, Max and Alex focused on back-end.
  - We then created the issues on Gitlab and decided on having five labels: 3 for importance: calm, mild and urgent, and 2 for the structure: front-end and back-end.
  - On Monday, we had a meeting where we designed each screen for our application.
  - This week, we will finish the HCI report draft and start coding.
    - Establish a strategy for coding. What happens when someone is stuck? Which resources should we use to support us? How can we use our weekly Tuesday meetings in an efficient manner?

## Action plan for next week (Scrum board)

_Which issues from the backlog can we work on this week?_

- Transfer issues from backlog to sprint board on Gitlab as a team.

## Group feedback

  - Code of Conduct feedback
